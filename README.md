*Simulation for Problem 7 Conical Piles*

The dynamics of sandpile is considered as a systematic event emerge from interactions among massive sand particles, which could be modeled by Cellular Automaton.

## Contents
1. automata.py: class of cellular automaton, doctest and comments included 
2. simulation.py: code to run simulation and parameter sweep include u1,u2, k
3. animation.py: visualization, simulation data -> animation, saved to .mp4 files for both top and side views
4. cal_angle: calulate the repose angle of sandpile, generate angle-time curve
5. cal_energy: calulate the total energy and collision loss at every iteration, time curve generated

## Final
